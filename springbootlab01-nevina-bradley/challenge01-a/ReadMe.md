Where the `MaintanenceRequest` model should have :

* id - its position in the database
* firstName - first name of tenent making the request
* lastName - last name of tenent making the request
* email - email request of tenent making the request
* aptNumber - Apartment number of the tenent making the request
* description - description of the request for maintanence
* createAt - time stamp of when the request was made.


## Step 01 :

Create a new Spring App called `maintanence-request-server`

Make sure you have the following dependences:

* Web - Spring Web handles web request
* Lombok - Simplfies creating models
* JPA - Java Persistence API
* H2 - The Database

Place the folder in your dev folder, then create a new REPO in github and push the changes up.

## Step 02 :

Create the full application with the following structure
 
```
